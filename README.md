# Auto Data Collection Through Email
To use this project I would send an email to the email account associated with the python script.
The python auto script would run at a scheduled time (11 PM), collect the data from the email and insert it into the mysql database.

## Graphs
Below is the first graph I made for the weather data.
- The days have been averaged together by the temperature to prevent repeating days on the graph.
