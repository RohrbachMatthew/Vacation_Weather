# Auto Data Collection Through Email

To use this project I would send an email to the email account associated with the python script.
The python auto script would run at a scheduled time (11 PM), collect the data from the email and insert it into the mysql database.

## Files:
- [click here for the python script](https://github.com/RohrbachMatthew/Vacation_Weather/blob/main/weather_email_auto_python/main.py) - This is the Script for the graphs that were made
- [click here for table creation file](https://github.com/RohrbachMatthew/Vacation_Weather/blob/main/create_table_and_index.sql) - This is a .sql file to create the database table

---
## Graphs
Below is the first graph I made for the weather data.
- The days have been averaged together by the temperature to prevent repeating days on the graph.
